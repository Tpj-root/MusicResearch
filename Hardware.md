Yes 👍 On Debian you can generate tones with these tools:

* **sox** → `sudo apt install sox`
  Example:

  ```bash
  play -n synth 2 sine 440
  ```

  (Plays 440 Hz A for 2 seconds)

* **beep** → `sudo apt install beep`
  Example:

  ```bash
  beep -f 440 -l 500
  ```

  (440 Hz tone for 500 ms)

* **csound** or **puredata** → advanced sound synthesis.




Got it 👍 The reason your two commands sound **slightly different** is:

* `sox play` → generates a **pure sine wave** (clean tone).
* `beep` → uses the **PC speaker** (square wave, buzzy sound).

But both can be set to the **same frequency & duration**:

### 🎵 Using `sox`:

```bash
play -n synth 0.5 sine 440
```

(0.5 sec, 440 Hz, pure sine wave)

### 🎵 Using `beep`:

```bash
beep -f 440 -l 500
```

(500 ms = 0.5 sec, 440 Hz, PC speaker square wave)

👉 Both will give **440 Hz for 0.5 sec**.
Only difference = sine (smooth) vs square (buzzy).



Ah 👍 that error means your system **doesn’t have a PC speaker device**, so `beep` can’t work.

On modern Debian laptops/desktops:

* Many machines **don’t have a physical PC speaker** anymore.
* Or it’s disabled in the kernel (module `pcspkr` not loaded).

### ✅ Workaround

Use **SoX (`play`)** instead → it works through your normal audio output (headphones / speakers).

Example:

```bash
sudo apt install sox
play -n synth 0.5 sine 440
```

That will always work as long as sound is enabled.





Yes 👍 here’s a **ready command set** using **SoX (`play`)** to generate all 12 semitones (C–B, equal temperament, A4=440 Hz).

Each plays **0.5 seconds** tone:

```bash
# Western chromatic scale from C4 (261.63 Hz) to B4 (493.88 Hz)

play -n synth 0.5 sine 261.63   # C4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 277.18   # C#4 / Db4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 293.66   # D4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 311.13   # D#4 / Eb4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 329.63   # E4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 349.23   # F4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 369.99   # F#4 / Gb4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 392.00   # G4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 415.30   # G#4 / Ab4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 440.00   # A4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 466.16   # A#4 / Bb4
play -n synth 0.5 sine 493.88   # B4
```

👉 This will step through **all 12 notes** in one octave.





Perfect 👍 Here’s a small **Bash script** that will play the full **chromatic scale (C4–B4)** in sequence using SoX:

Save it as `chromatic.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Play chromatic scale C4 to B4 using SoX
# Each note = 0.5 sec sine wave

NOTES=(
  261.63  # C4
  277.18  # C#4/Db4
  293.66  # D4
  311.13  # D#4/Eb4
  329.63  # E4
  349.23  # F4
  369.99  # F#4/Gb4
  392.00  # G4
  415.30  # G#4/Ab4
  440.00  # A4
  466.16  # A#4/Bb4
  493.88  # B4
)

for f in "${NOTES[@]}"; do
  echo "Playing $f Hz"
  play -n synth 0.5 sine $f
done
```

### Usage:

```bash
chmod +x chromatic.sh
./chromatic.sh
```

It will play each note in sequence like a **keyboard scale** 🎹.





Yes 👍 here’s a **Carnatic scale (Sa–Ri–Ga–Ma–Pa–Da–Ni–Sa)** script using **SoX**.
I’ll assume **Sa = C4 = 261.63 Hz**.

Save as `carnatic.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Carnatic basic 7 notes (Sa–Ri2–Ga3–Ma1–Pa–Da2–Ni3–Sa)
# Frequencies approximate (equal temperament mapping with Sa=C4)

NOTES=(
  261.63  # Sa (C4)
  293.66  # Ri2 (D4)
  329.63  # Ga3 (E4)
  349.23  # Ma1 (F4)
  392.00  # Pa (G4)
  440.00  # Da2 (A4)
  493.88  # Ni3 (B4)
  523.25  # Sa (C5, next octave)
)

NAMES=("Sa" "Ri" "Ga" "Ma" "Pa" "Da" "Ni" "Sa")

for i in "${!NOTES[@]}"; do
  echo "Playing ${NAMES[$i]} -> ${NOTES[$i]} Hz"
  play -n synth 0.5 sine "${NOTES[$i]}"
done
```

### Usage:

```bash
chmod +x carnatic.sh
./carnatic.sh
```

This will play **Sa–Ri–Ga–Ma–Pa–Da–Ni–Sa** like a Carnatic practice 🎶.

👉 Do you want me to also add **all 12 Carnatic swarasthanas** (Ri1, Ri2, Ri3, Ga1, Ga2, Ga3… Ma1, Ma2, etc.) in a script, so you can hear the *difference*?
